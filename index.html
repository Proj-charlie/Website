		<p class="paragraph-3">Up-keeping the performance and stability of a Minecraft server requires great effort from administrators. Making sure that add-ons work whilst simultaneously chasing after bugs and inconsistencies. This all takes time from what server administrators really should be doing, growing their server and focussing on the existing community.
		<p class="paragraph-3">With every upcoming Minecraft update, performance starts to degrade on a production server. This allows for an almost continious cycle of chasing performance issues and other matters on the subject of stability.</p>
		<p class="paragraph-3">In our own adventures, we faced the same problems. After spending countless hours working on patches we quickly realised the importance of delegation. If only we could spend less time on these chores, we'd be able to grow the server exponentially and give our players what they want. More features, events or gamemodes</p>

			<p class="paragraph-3">Even though I have a full-time job it doesn't mean I am sitting still. During my free time I educate myself to become a technical analyst (income generating) and a portfolio manager. In essence, my nightmare is volatility whilst I am also a slave towards it. It's contradicting, however, I am both a portfolio manager and a swing trader.<br><br></p>

					<h3 class="heading-5">Prevention</h3>
					<p class="paragraph-2">With the knowledge gathered from the two insitutions on right I'm aiming to get my Certified Financial Technician (CFTe) certificate which will be a benchmark of my knowledge when it comes to technical analysis and the market as a whole.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-5">Monitoring</h3>
					<p class="paragraph-2">It's difficult to generate substantial wealth when swing-trading. With the help of a few individuals I am gathering the knowledge to build a portofolio which is up to the level of professionals. This will also allow me to understand advanced risk management.</p>

					<h3 class="heading-5">Tweaking</br></h3>
					<p class="paragraph-2">Every Wednesday at market open I attend a live trading room. Where professionals and myself look for opportunities.<br></br>Once we finish trading, we get lectured at about things related to technical analysis.</p>
